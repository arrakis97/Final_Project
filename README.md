# Database-driven Webtechnology Final Project
This is my final project for the course Database-driven Webtechnology, taught by Stijn Eikelboom at the University of Groningen. I did this course during my minor, 
because I wanted to learn more about databases and interacting with databases.  
For this project I had to make a web application on which owners could post their room and tenants could contact the owner about the room. I had about five weeks 
for this project and did it on my own. Prior to this course I had not worked with PHP, HTML and CSS. In the first few weeks we had some assignments from which I 
learned PHP, but I had to learn HTML and CSS from scratch.  
I had a lot of fun with this project, especially the back-end part of the web application. I really enjoyed learning PHP and how to interact with a database. 
I am actually looking forward to doing more back-end related projects and I hope I can work on some fun projects when I have some more time.
